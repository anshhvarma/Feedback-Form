# FeedbackForm
A Feedback Form made using Java and JavaFX

It was a mini-project where our team planned to make an implicit feedback form but we couldn't make it complete but we have done best of parts of it such as Login, Logout, Form Structure, Submit and then calculating and displaying a complete report!

We used .fxml files to prepare the appearance/UI of the complete form!
